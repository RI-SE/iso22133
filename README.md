# Build to add Python wrapper with SWIG

## Windows 
1. Install swig by downloading swig from their webpage, the download should include a pre-compiled build for windows.
2. Add the path to the pre-compiled swig.exe file that you downloaded to path variabel in system enviroment. 
3. Download a C/C++ compiler such as Visual Studio(_MSC_VER) or MinGW (preferable 64bit,__GNUC__,  __MINGW32__ ).  
4. Add the path to the downloaded pre-compiled compiler to system enviroment in windows path variabel.
5. Test that you can access swig run in cmd.
    ```
    swig -version
    ```
    This will give you version number of your swig etc.
6. Test you compiler by running the command to run the compiler, this will be different depending on your compiler.
    On MinGW:
    ```
    g++ --version
    ```
    This will give output for the MinGW compiler.
7. Start your python virtual environment or use your base environment at your own risk.
8. Start terminal and move to iso22133 folder to the setup.py file folder.
9. Run the following command(It will build the python extension): 
    ```
    python setup.py build_ext
    ```
10. Now install the extension to your python virtual enviroment or add the generated .pyd (i think) file to your path in system enviroment.
11. For installation run in terminal:
    ```
    python setup.py install
    ```
    
## Linux
1. First install SWIG run:
    ```
    sudo apt install swig
    ```
### Python
2. Start your python virtual environment or use your base environment at your own risk.
3. Start terminal and move to iso22133 folder to the setup.py file folder.
4. Run the following command (it will build the python extension): 
    ```
    python setup.py build_ext
    ```
5. Now install the extension to your python virtual enviroment or add the generated .so file to your path in .bashrc(.zshrc)
6. For installation run in terminal:
    ```
    python setup.py install
    ```
### Java 
1. Make sure you have Java JDK is installed. 
2. Make sure the iso22133.i file includes the line %javaconst(1)
3. Run the following command which will create all the necessary java files.  
    ```
    swig -java iso22133.i
    ```
4. Compile using. ((Pick jdk applicaple to your machine))
    ```
    gcc -fPIC -Wall -c positioning.c iso22133.c iso22133_wrap.c -I/usr/lib/jvm/jdk-15.0.2/include/ -I/usr/lib/jvm/jdk-15.0.2/include/linux/ 
    ```
5. Create .so file
    ```
    gcc -shared positioning.o iso22133_wrap.o iso22133.o -o libiso22133.so
    ```
7. Copy your .so file to your other JNI libs or add the current folder to the path using:
    ```
    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=. #ksh

    ```
9. You should now be able to use this to create and compile a simple java test program such as this:

    ```
    public class isotest {
        static {
                    System.loadLibrary("iso22133");
        }

        public static void main(String argv[]) {
            timeval heabTime = new timeval();
            System.out.println(ControlCenterStatusType.CONTROL_CENTER_STATUS_ABORT);

            iso22133 iso = new iso22133();
            iso.encodeHEABMessage(heabTime, ControlCenterStatusType.CONTROL_CENTER_STATUS_RUNNING, "datatadatadata", 22, '1');
            }
    }
      ```


# Build for ARM
Install the compilers
```
sudo apt install gcc-arm-linux-gnueabihf g++-arm-linux-gnueabihf
```

Change to the build directory, then compile and build with the toolchain
```
cmake .. -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=../Toolchain_arm.cmake
sudo make
```
